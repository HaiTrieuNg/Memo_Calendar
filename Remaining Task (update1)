Export Button: implemented but still need to test and apply more logic

Buttons edge cases (exp when nothing is chosen but the user clicks Delete or Edit, these buttons should do nothing)

The navigation can go as far as the Gregorian Calendar can make it (for now, we allow 2000-2050, figured out that it  should be 1019-2999)

When you click on a particular date, the current view on frame 2 will change accordingly (not pop up a new frame but change the frame)
